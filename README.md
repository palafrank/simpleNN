# simpleNN
A Neural Network implementation in Python using numpy and other useful libraries.

- Am image classifier for cat images (or anything that the model is trained for)
- Incrementally adding neural network concepts to the project as I learn the intution behind the concepts
- Goal is to get an optimized neural network with tunable parameters as I discover new concepts
- The Test and Images directory have sample images for learning and testing. (Currently a small set but will grow over time for enabling mini-batching and more accuratle learning)
